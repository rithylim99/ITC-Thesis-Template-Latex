\section*{\centering ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS}
First and most importantly, I would like to take this opportunity to express my deepest thanks to my family for their endless love, support, and encouragement. Words cannot express how grateful I am to my parents for their sacrifices that they have made on me. I have to thank my sisters and brother for their excellent advice, and encouragement for the past 5 years I studied in ITC.
I would like to express my sincere thanks to Dr. OM Romny, general director of ITC, for his good management and good cooperation with partnership universities inside the country and abroad, and for reinforcement of quality of engineer and high-level technician. I am also grateful to Dr. BUN Long, head of Electrical and Energy Department, and Mr. CHY Cheapok, former head of Electrical and Energy Department for his good management and their taking part in teaching. I would like to express my thanks to Mr. SUON Sovann, president of Electrical Engineering Student Club (EESC) for providing me the fund to complete my project. 
I wish to express my special appreciation and thanks to my adviser Dr. BUN Long who has been a very good mentor for me. I would like to thank him for his explanation, guidance, and suggestions during the time I conducted my thesis project. Without his guidance, this work would not have been completed.
At the end, I would like to express my gratitude to all lectures in the Department of Electrical and Energy Engineering for their teaching and sharing experience during my time at ITC. I also thanks to all of my friends, especially to Mr. NGET Chandara, Mr. NEANG Seanghakk, Mr. PHON Phanit and my other juniors whose names I didn't mention. They have a big impact for helping me finishing my final year thesis successfully.
